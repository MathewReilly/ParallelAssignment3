# ParallelAssignment3
There are two problem files. Note Assignment3P1.cpp does not work, but I have my code that shows attempted implementation.
### To run with gcc:
```
  gcc -lstdc++ -std=c++11 -o presents.out Assignment3P1.cpp
  ./presents.out
```

```
  gcc -lstdc++ -std=c++11 -o sensor.out Assignment3P2.cpp
  ./sensor.out
```

### To run with g++:
```
  g++ -std=c++11 -o presents.out Assignment3P1.cpp
  ./presents.out
```

```
  g++ -std=c++11 -o sensor.out Assignment3P2.cpp
  ./sensor.out
```
